## Who are OnBuy? üåê
Since being awarded as the **'eCommerce Company of the Year'** at the 2020 UK Business Tech Awards, we have gone on to raise ¬£35 million in a Series A+ funding round and have quickly become recognised as being one of the fastest-growing eCommerce companies in the world. 

We are on a mission to provide ‚Äòthe most transparent and fair-trading platform‚Äô for sellers, and a place where buyers can easily find what they need, every day. What sets OnBuy apart from other marketplaces is that we don‚Äôt compete with our sellers, we don‚Äôt sell our own products and we don‚Äôt have our own warehouses, which creates a more efficient business model that allows us to focus on the customer experience and helps us to reinforce trust in our sellers, and the platform itself. 

More recently we received PCR Awards **'Online Retailer of the Year 2021'** and have been moving from strength-to-strength with new partnerships including Hermes, ShipStation and the LEGO Group just to name a few - consistently striving to build the best-in-class eCommerce platform for buyers and sellers alike!

## Let's talk Tech üñ•Ô∏è
With all this in mind, OnBuy have technology at the forefront of our philosophy. On our quest to becoming the best eCommerce platform we are always looking to make leaps in improving our service to both buyers & sellers, from functionality right through to performance and efficiency. As such, we are currently scaling across a multitude of different technical areas to accomodate continuous improvement both for the platform itself - but also the **career development** of all the great people who work here at OnBuy!

Our business is at a pivotal stage in it's scaling, where every project completed can have a clear, visual impact. This is something I think is extremely exciting, joining an organisation where YOU are able to see the effects of your work on a daily basis while also helping to achieve overarching goals. If you are looking for a new opportunity where you can *have a direct impact and grow your own expertise* this is the company for you!
